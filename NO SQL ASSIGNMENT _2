HBASE DATABASE:
        HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of the Hadoop file system. It is an open-source project and is horizontally scalable.
        HBase is a data model that is similar to Google’s big table designed to provide quick random access to huge amounts of structured data.
        It leverages the fault tolerance provided by the Hadoop File System (HDFS).
        It is a part of the Hadoop ecosystem that provides random real-time read/write access to data in the Hadoop File System.
        One can store the data in HDFS either directly or through HBase. Data consumer reads/accesses the data in HDFS randomly using HBase.
        HBase sits on top of the Hadoop File System and provides read and write access.
HBASE SHELL:
        HBase contains a shell using which you can communicate with HBase.
        HBase uses the Hadoop File System to store its data.
        It will have a master server and region servers.
        The data storage will be in the form of regions (tables).
        These regions will be split up and stored in region servers.
        The master server manages these region servers and all these tasks take place on HDFS.
DESIGNING RULES:
      1. Design the database schema carefully to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.
      2. Use row keys to store the primary keys for the records.
      3. Use composite row keys when needed for data retrieval.
      4. Implement secondary indexes to ensure fast query performance.
      5. Use column qualifiers to store the data associated with each field.
      6. Store related data together in a single row or column family.
      7. Keep the number of columns and row keys limited for efficient data storage and retrieval.
      8. Use compression to reduce storage space and improve query performance.
      9. Use bloom filters to reduce the number of unnecessary disk reads.
      10. Use coprocessors to offload processing and improve query performance.
SYNTAX:
      Creating a Table using HBase Shell:
             create ‘<table name>’,’<column family1>’,’<column family2>’
      Inserting Data using HBase Shell:(PUT COMMAND)
             put ’<table name>’,’row1’,’<colfamily:colname>’,’<value>’
      Deleting a Specific Cell in a Table:
             delete ‘<table name>’, ‘<row>’, ‘<column name >’ OR
             delete ‘<table name>’, ‘<row>’, ‘<column name >’, ‘<time stamp>’
      Updating Data using HBase Shell:
             put ‘table name’,’row ’,'Column family:column name',’new value’
      Searching Data using HBase Shell:
             get ’<table name>’,’row1’
